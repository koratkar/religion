**I. Open Source Religion**

I don't know what to call this religion yet, but I have a rough idea of what I want the open source mechanic to work like, which I will state before I yield you the doctrines.

1. You can fork this religion
2. Each branch must allow open dialects with anyone who pleases. We do this through our "dialects" feature, which is called "Issues" in GitHub.
3. Branches update through dialects turning into pull requests
4. If you create a branch that cannot be forked or that is not open to dialects, then that will not be considered a fork of this religion.

The problem with starting a religion like this is that religions are usually built bottom-up, while most multi-human endeavors that fail are built top-down. The open source idea is pretty bottom-up, but starting out with main tenets is top-down. Going bottom-up gives you much more room to change things. It's like you're on a mountain range and at the tallest peak is the best religion possible, but you have to sometimes go into small valleys and ravines to find the tallest peak. You have to go down to go up. That's why you can fork this religion. Some forks will be good, some forks will be bad. We copy what the good ones do. Sometimes, bad forks will suddenly be good forks. Sometimes, you have to fail to succeed. Actually no, you *have* to fail to succeed. Failure is success. 

**II. Tenets**

Alright, here are the main tenets of the religion (tentative, even on main branch).

1. Each and every human is inherently good;
2. Their flaws and negative actions surface from grime on the window to their soul;
3. The grime can be removed to allow the goodness to shine through.
4. Happiness and purpose are good things and it makes sense to pursue them using a scientific or empirical approach, though not a naively empirical or faux rational approach. 
5. There is a non-conscious or subconscious thing inside you which often has really good answers to basic problems in life (e.g. back pain, acne, staying fit), and sometimes modernity and civilization can get in the way of that voice;
6. That voice is really weird and speaks in even weirder ways;
7. It's hard to say it doesn't exist since some people have that crazy wisdom or knowledge about the world and they didn't read self-help books or take courses on how to get so wise or smart (e.g. babies learning to speak without teachers, great engineers/scientists/writers/musicians/artists feeling compelled to do their workâ€”in other words, their work was actually fun and not a chore).


Now, I don't think souls or gods exist, but are primarily useful ideas for understanding and labeling strange concepts. Our religion will not be belief based in particular, though if you want to start a God fork, feel free. I'm hoping for some good polytheistic forks, which brings me to my next point.

**III. Stories***

Religions are primarily a collection of stories, of whose beliefs and ideas are only sometimes written down. When those beliefs and ideas are written down, they're usually aphorisms. Take, for example, the statement "you should treat others the way you want to be treated." What does it mean? It's just words. Now take this story.

> Rob was down on his luck. He was homeless and no one was giving him money. He wanted to be a great actor. So he went to audition for a sitcom. He laughed and laughed at the auditions before him, because he knew he was a better actor. When he finally auditioned, it was like his heart took over his brain. He was wonderful. But when the results came out, he had to settle for a minor role because he was considered hard to work with. He still didn't have a house and the meager money he had was not enough to support himself and he slept in an IKEA model bedroom near the set. One day, he walked out onto the street, and he saw a homeless man. He gave money to a homeless person, who he knew to be even more unlucky. The homeless man smiled and then took his hat off. "Hi, I'm Christopher Nolan. Do you want to be in my upcoming movie?"

Ah! It's so contrived! A person is bad and he gets punished. Then he becomes good and is rewarded. Whatever you think, it's more effective than "be nice to people." Of course, the problem is that it predicates being kind will get you rewarded, which is not a very good reason to be kind. But you get the point. Stories > Doctrines.The reason big religions like Christianity continue are because they offer you something in their *stories* which speaks to the goodness inside us, not in their testaments or whatever. 

Therefore, our religion will primarily use stories to communicate and try to rely less on doctrines. 

One thing I've been sort of thinking about is how what you say doesn't matter. It's better to live in the shape of the person you want not only yourself to be like, but also others than to tell people how you want them to be. For instance, when I say "this is a great solution to your problem," no one ever listens to me. When I *act* that solution out, they do. Or another trick is to make them feel like they came up with the answer themselves, which I've never really figured out how to do. But doing is better saying by thirty-fold.

**IV. Organization**

The directory structure of our religion is like this:

religion
|
|---readme.md
|---stories
	|---readme.md
	|---story1.txt
	|---story2.txt
	|---story3.txt
	|---etc...
|---doctrines
	|---readme.md
	|---idea1.txt
	|---idea2.txt
	|---etc...

The stories can be of whatever shape or form you want them to be as long as they can give you a message on how to live a better life. If I say anything more than that you should read Dan Harmon's Story Structure 101 essays, then I'll be ruining the moment. The ideas should be useful aphorisms and evidence based ideas on how to live. Think Nassim Taleb books. 

The stories are not owned by any entity and should be thrown around and passed around like a hot potato. Stories are subject to an evolutionary kinda process. The good ones become popular, the bad ones fade away. If we apply copy right on our stories, that's bad. If a story is good and makes you feel like you better understand how to live well, then share it, maybe even print it out and give it to your friends. If it doesn't, then don't. 

To recap, religion, in our definition of the word, is about a semi-organized community coalescing to figure out how to live life better in a strange and alien world. It uses myths and legends to convey these ideas, while also relying a little bit on doctrines and beliefs. 

"Isn't this just restarting the rationalist community but calling it a religion?"

No. The rationalist community is centered around LessWrong and SlateStarCodex. We're an open source directory of stories and doctrines (and hopefully meet-ups and talks) that aim to figure out how to live a good life in a weird world.
